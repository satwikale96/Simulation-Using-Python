# Ski Lift Simulation

SimPy is a discrete event simulation framework in Python that is process based and allows users to model components in real time, as fast as possible, or incrementally by stepping through each event. This example compared the effect of adding a single rider line to a ski lift queue and found that the addition improved key metrics such as average wait time, utilization, rider throughput, and average queue length.
